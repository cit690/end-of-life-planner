### About the App

One of my greatest, yet most misunderstood passions in end of life advocacy. It is safe to say that in our cultures most people are a bit squeamish when it comes to the topic of death, so the conversation is largely avoided. Due to this lack of conversation many people don't realize the rights they have in regards to their own deaths as well as their loved ones, and they're largely unaware of the funeral options that they have. With this app, my hope is for people to get their wishes for their end of life seen; with a platform to organize their thoughts and plans so that it is out there in the world for their loved ones to see.
